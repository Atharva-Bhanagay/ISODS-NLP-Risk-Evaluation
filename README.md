Objective:
The main objective of this project is to analyze customer tweets related to CVS Health in the USA from February 1, 2022, to August 1, 2022. The focus is on identifying potential risks and issues raised by customers through their tweets, aiming to enhance CVS's competitiveness. The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment analysis and risk classification.

Description:
This project involves the analysis of a dataset comprising over 25,000 tweets from CVS Health customers. The dataset spans from February 1, 2022, to August 1, 2022, and contains two key columns:

Tweets: This column includes the text of individual tweets, covering a range of topics such as product reviews, customer experiences, and general discussions about CVS.

Risk Analysis: The "Risk Analysis" column assigns a binary value to each tweet, where "0" indicates no identified risk, and "1" signifies the presence of a potential problem that could negatively impact CVS's competitiveness.

The dataset has been previously utilized in The International Society of Data Scientists NLP Competition, where the model achieved an impressive accuracy of 85.75% in identifying risks associated with customer tweets. The risk analysis is crucial for CVS Health to proactively address issues raised by customers, thereby ensuring customer satisfaction and maintaining the company's competitive edge.

The analysis involves Natural Language Processing techniques to extract insights from the textual data, enabling the identification of areas for improvement and risk mitigation. The project's findings aim to provide actionable insights for CVS Health to enhance its overall customer experience and competitiveness in the market. The achieved accuracy of 85.75% in the NLP competition underscores the effectiveness of the approach in identifying and classifying potential risks from customer tweets.
